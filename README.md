# TSA Complaints Data Set

This repository contains data contained by the Data Liberation Project.  This data was compiled in an attempt to make public and simplify a significant amount of government data that is otherwise difficult to use. 


# Motivation
The TSA is the government agency responsible for airport security nationwide.  As a public agency, it is important to understand where the TSA is falling short.  We need to know what the common complaints are against the TSA, and where and when these issues tend to occur.  Hopefully we can use this data to recognize where the TSA can improve and enact changes to the agency that better serve travelers in the US.  

# Summary of findings
  There are a number of interesting trends and key findings from this data.  I think the biggest issue that this analysis unearths is that persons with disabilities remain the highest category of complaint year after year.  If it was one year that may be an anomaly, but the consistency of this complain suggests that the TSA does a very poor job of accommodating those with disabilities.  The other top category of complaints that jumps out is civil rights.  With over 50,000 civil rights complaints over the course of this data, I feel that there may a significant systemic issue with how the TSA handles the rights of travelers, especially those of minority groups.  
  Another key finding is the airports which have the highest number of complaints.  Some would expect some of the top culprits like Orlando, JFK and LAX which all handle a massive number of visitors.  Denver and SeaTac are near the top of the list.  These are comparatively much, much smaller airports than the others listed and show that they must have consistently terrible service.  Having used both airports extensively, I think this matches up to my personal experience.
  Timing of complaints throughout the year also yields some unexpected results.  When looking at complaints on a quarterly basis, one would likely expect the bust travel time of the holidays to have the most complaints by far.  While there are more complaints during this time, it’s not significantly higher than the other quarters of the year.  Additionally, when we look at the number of complaints by month of year we see a similar trend.  The overall number of complaints remains extremely flat over the entire course of the year – travel period doesn’t seem to affect number of complaints to any significant degree.
  There are other insights to be gained from this data, but these are some key findings that I found most interesting.  Feel free to look through the data and analysis to see what insights you can draw from it.
