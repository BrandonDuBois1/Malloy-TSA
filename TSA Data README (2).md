# TSA Complaints Data Set

This repository contains data contained by the Data Liberation Project.  This data was compiled in an attempt to make public and simplify a significant amount of government data that is otherwise difficult to use. 


# Motivation
The TSA is the government agency responsible for airport security nationwide.  As a public agency, it is important to understand where the TSA is falling short.  We need to know what the common complaints are against the TSA, and where and when these issues tend to occur.  Hopefully we can use this data to recognize where the TSA can improve and enact changes to the agency that better serve travelers in the US.
